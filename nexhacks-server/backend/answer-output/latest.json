  "answer": "Okay, let's clarify. You have a circuit with a 6V source (V1), two 1k\u03a9 resistors (R1 and R2), and an LED (LED1).  I see some components placed on the breadboard, but not all of them are labeled. Could you tell me which components are connected to each node (N1-N5) as you've placed them on the breadboard? Specifically, which component is connected to A10, A12, A14, and so on?",
  "actions": [],
  "followups": [
    "Please list the components and their corresponding breadboard locations (e.g., 'resistor_1 at A10')."
