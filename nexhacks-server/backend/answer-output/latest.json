  "answer": "Based on your observed board placement, it looks like you've correctly connected the components for a simple LED circuit. V1 (6V) is at J22 and B29, R1 is at I22 and I29, R2 is at H22 and E29, and LED1 is at H29 and E29.  There's nothing immediately obvious in the analysis, so let's check a few things to ensure it's working correctly.",
