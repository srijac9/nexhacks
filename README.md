# BREAD.board
BREAD.board was inspired by our own experiences learning to build circuits throughout High School. While schematics and textbooks explain what to connect, they often fall short in showing how to physically assemble components on a breadboard. Whenever we were stuck or confused about wiring up components a certain way, we didn't have real-time guidance or feedback to ask questions and understand the concept behind what we were trying to achieve.

We felt the gap between understanding a circuit diagram and successfully building it, especially for beginners. This motivated us to create a tool we wished we had when we were learning to build circuits, an interactive guide that uses a live camera feed to provide step-by-step instructions and real-time feedback and answers to questions while building circuits. Our goal is to make learning electronics more accessible, intuitive, and fun by bridging the gap between theory and hands-on practice.

## What it does?
Our app helps users build electronic circuits on a breadboard using real-time, interactive guidance. Users upload circuit schematics, and the app analyzes the circuit diagram to provide real-time guidance. Using a live camera feed from the user’s phone, the system monitors the breadboard as the user places components. The app provides immediate feedback, confirming correct placements, highlighting mistakes, answering questions and guiding the user to the next step. Instructions are delivered through text-to-speech audio, allowing users to focus on building without constantly checking their screen. This creates a hands-on, guided learning experience that bridges the gap between understanding circuit diagrams and successfully assembling them in the real world.
